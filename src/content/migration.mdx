## Monolith to Microservice Migration

### Problem
A legacy Java J2EE monolith running on IBM WebSphere had tightly coupled deployments
and long release cycles (~41 days). A single backend change required coordination
across multiple teams and extensive regression testing.

### Approach
I incrementally extracted a Spring Boot service from the monolith, migrating one
endpoint at a time. The existing frontend was reused to validate behavior in test
environments, avoiding a risky big-bang rewrite.

### Key Decisions
- Chose Cloud SQL over globally distributed databases due to non-global scale
  requirements and the need for operational simplicity
- Prioritized deployment isolation and rollback safety over premature scalability
- Containerized the service early to stabilize environments and reduce config drift

### Outcome
Releases moved to sprint-level cadence, operational risk was reduced, and clear
ownership boundaries were established for the extracted service.
